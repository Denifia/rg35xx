# Themes

1. Copy your theme folders into here
2. Launch Consoles > Themes > `! Check for themes` on your device
3. Open the theme you want to switch to

## Expected structure

- Roms
- Themes
  - CatOS (or any other theme name - spaces are fine)
    - font
    - lang
    - misc
      - boot_logo.bmp.gz
    - skin
      - system
        - (console icons live here)
    - rgui (for retroarch themes)

For now, stick with themes that have AT LEAST a font, lang and/or skin folder. If all 3 are missing, switching to the font will just revert to Garlic OS default. All the themes from [rg35xx.com](https://www.rg35xx.com/en/garlicos-themes/) should work just fine.

Presence of `/Themes/theme name/misc/boot_logo.bmp.gz` will make a "theme name - boot logo" option.
Presence of `/Themes/theme name/skin/system` will make a "theme name - icons only" option.
