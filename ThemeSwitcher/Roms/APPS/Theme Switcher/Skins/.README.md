# Themes

1. Copy your themes, boot logo and system icon folders into here
2. Launch Consoles > Themes > `! Check for themes` on your device
3. ✨ Pick the one you want to swap to it ✨

## Expected structure

- Roms
  - Themes
    - "CatOS" (example theme - spaces are fine)
      - font
      - Imgs (for previews)
      - lang
      - misc
        - boot_logo.bmp.gz
      - skin
      - rgui (for retroarch themes)
    - "Systems White" (example system icons)
      - Imgs (for previews)
      - system
    - "Black Seraph" (example boot logo)
      - Imgs (for previews)
      - misc
        - boot_logo.bmp.gz

All the Theme, Boot Logo and System Icon downloads from [rg35xx.com](https://www.rg35xx.com/en/garlicos-themes/) should work just fine.

Presence of `/Roms/Themes/{name}/misc/boot_logo.bmp.gz` will make a "{name} - boot logo" option.
Presence of `/Roms/Themes/{name}/skin/system` will make a "{name} - system icons" option.
