# Themes

1. Copy your themes into `/Themes` (next to your `/Roms`)
2. Copy your boot logos into `/BootLogos` (next to your `/Roms`)
3. Copy your system icons into `/SystemIcons` (next to your `/Roms`)
4. Launch Consoles > Themes > `! Refresh` on your device
5. ✨ Pick the one you want to swap to ✨

## APPs

- "Theme Switcher - Install" will set most things up for you. You still need to download and copy themes/boot logos/system icons onto your sd card
- "Theme Switcher - Uninstall" will remove almost everything but leave your downloads alone
- "Theme Switcher - (Un)hide" will toggle the "Skins" console/tile on and off

Feel free to delete "Theme Switcher - Uninstall" or prefix the file name with a "." if you don't intend on uninstalling and don't want the entry in your APPS.

## Expected structure

- Roms
  - APPS
    - "Theme Switcher - (Un)hide.sh"
    - "Theme Switcher - Uninstall.sh"
  - Skins
    - all the needed scripts are automagically created here
- Themes
  - "CatOS" (example theme - spaces are fine)
    - font
    - Imgs (for previews)
    - lang
    - misc
      - boot_logo.bmp.gz (the boot logo preview is pulled out of this)
    - skin
    - rgui (for retroarch themes)
- BootLogos
  - "Black Seraph" (example boot logo)
    - misc
      - boot_logo.bmp.gz (the preview is pulled out of this)
- SystemIcons
  - "Systems White" (example system icons)
    - Imgs (for previews)
    - system

All the Theme, Boot Logo and System Icon downloads from [rg35xx.com](https://www.rg35xx.com/en/garlicos-themes/) should work just fine.

Presence of `/Roms/Themes/{name}/misc/boot_logo.bmp.gz` will make a "{name} - boot logo" option.
