# Reload Themes

Automation to help you hot swap themes by "playing" a theme as if it was a game rom. Includes retroarch theme (but doesn't select it) and boot logo if they're provided in the theme.

## Setup

This works for 1 or 2 SD CARD setups and edits the coremapping.json for you make it all work.

- Copy the `Roms` and `Themes` folder to the root of your sdcard
- Copy your themes into `Themes`
- Boot your device, go to Consoles > APPS (the picture of a terminal) > open "Install Theme Switcher"
- Go to Consoles > Themes > open "! Reload Themes"
- Open any theme you want to switch to it

Any time you add/edit/remove themes on your sdcard, you'll need to run the "! Reload Themes" again.
