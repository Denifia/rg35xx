# Reload Themes

Mix and match themes, boot logos and system icons on the fly.

## Setup

This works for 1 or 2 SD CARD setups and edits the coremapping.json for you make it all work.

- Copy the files into `/Roms/APPS/`
- On your device go to Consoles > APPS (the picture of a terminal) > open "Theme Switcher - Install"
- Copy your themes into `/Roms/Themes`
- On your device go to Consoles > Themes > open "! check for themes"
- Open any theme you want to switch to it

Any time you add/rename/remove themes in `/Roms/Themes`, you'll need to run the "! Check for themes" again.

To remove it, run "Theme Switcher - Uninstall" from APPS. It doesn't delete the theme folders you copied into `/Roms/Themes` because you may want to keep them.
