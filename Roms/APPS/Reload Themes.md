# Reload Themes

Automation to help you hot swap themes by "playing" a theme as if it was a game rom. Includes retroarch theme (but doesn't select it) and boot logo if they're provided in the theme.

## Setup

This works for 1 or 2 SD CARD setups.

- Next to your `Roms` folder, create a new folder called `Themes`
- Copy any theme you want into that folder
- Copy `Reload Themes.sh` file from this repo into `Roms/APPS` (make the `APPS` folder if it doesn't exist)
- Boot your device, go to Consoles > APPS (the picture of a terminal) > open "Reload Themes"
  - If all went well, you should get 3 ascending vibrations
  - If it failed, you'll get 2 descending vibrations
- Go to Consoles > THEMES > open any theme you want to switch to it
