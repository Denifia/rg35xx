# PDF Reader

Allows you to load game manuals (I got mine from Skraper) or any other PDF right on your device.

Check for new PDFs with "! Refresh".

- Scans for /PDFs/\*.pdf and /Roms/\*/Manuals/\*.pdf files and make scripts to launch them in /Roms/Read

## Setup

> Note: If PDF's don't load after you've just installed the mod, reboot your device.

Download the latest "PDF Reader" release (see sidebar), extract and copy all to /Roms/APPS.

Install with "PDF Reader - Install".

- Makes /Roms/Read and copies some scripts & utilities into it
- Makes /PDFs if it doesn't exist
- Add a "PDF Reader - Uninstall" APP

Uninstall with "PDF Reader - Uninstall".

- Removes /Roms/Read and everything in it
- Removes PDF Reader from /Roms/APPS
